The Schrödinger 2D Sketcher is an open-source application for drawing and editing chemical structures. The entire sketcher is built on top of the RDKit open source toolkit, which serves as its underlying chemical model. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating molecules, reactions, and other chemical diagrams, which can be used independently or integrated into other cheminformatics workflows.

This project is released by Schrödinger, Inc. and is available under an open-source license to foster collaboration and development within the scientific community.

## Features
